Many ideas were thrown around, including the implementation of trees, nested arraylists, and more, but I decided on creating a map. Thought it probably wasn't going to be the fastest method as we just had a problemset about maps, I thought that if I stored the prefix's of each word in an array, similar to the noodle problem on the quiz, that I could get instant time lookups for anything below 4-5 characters and relatively fast searches for anything longer by iterating through its prefix and the next one, only searching through a few words instead of all 150,000. |

I approached this by iterating through the entire dictionary, then utilizing a separate method that took the current word, converted the first four letters of it into two digit integer 01 through 26, and then converted that string of numbers into an integer to use as the index. This took a bit of time but seems to have worked well. |

At this point, I had read all the prefixes into the map that I created with the indicies of their first appearance in the diction as the value at their index. Because I had this done, I began working on the iteration of every word from the text and then checking whether or not they're greater than the lengths of the prefixes (4) and then going from there. If the word length was equal or less to the prefix length, I converted the word into an integer, checked the index of my map at that integer, and said it was a real word if it wasn't equal to zero. Otherwise, place the word into my array of mispelled words. If the words were greater than four characters, it did the same thing but for the first four letters, then used that index to find the next prefix index, and iterated through the dictionary between the two values stores at the maps indicies for the prefix and then the next vcalid prefixl, limiting the search range. |
| September 25 |  1:50-2:20pm  | During the first half of class or so, I was running through the test cases for each o the SpellChecks as I finished all my methods, but kept encountering errors saying that my list of mispelled words was either too long or too short. It wasn't off by a large margin, so I knew most of my code was probably correct, and decided to see which words specfically it was getting wrong. What I found was that all the words it was getting wrong were less than four letters or had special characters that I didn't account for and then also a, the first word in the dictionary that has a position of 0 meaning the value stored in the prefix array was the same as the value repesenting that it wasn't a real prefix. Because of this information, I first fixed the problem with A by simply adding some or statements that had it be included as a prefix, and then I went into my code and checked why the special characters weren't working. I realized some characters that were recgnized as alphabetical weren't A through Z and that there were also apostrophes, so I had any value that wasn't A-Z default to a 00 so that the code would still run as a temporary solution and most things would still be correct. After that, I invested the problem with short words and found that any word that was a prefix, but wasn't actually in the dictionary, was being included when it should have been a mispelled word, and added another clause when checking the words less than length four that location their index points to in the dictionary is actually equal to the word itself rather than the prefix simply being the same. |

I also realized that one main reason my code was slow on bigger sets was because I had to iterate through the entirety of my mispelled word list every time I wanted to check if something was there or not, which was really slow if it was large, so it gave me another reason to try out hash tables. Didn't have enough time for any implementation but it was useful information and will hopefully help later (maybe). |

Not much of note changed in my code other than trying to create a map for mispelled words which didn't have much success as I would need more than just their prefix to know if they were mispelled previously and that would cause lots of errors to show up if there were mispelled words that contained other mispelled words. |

May have gotten things to work but need to make sure that the look up and insertion functions are as intended. Expand upon more later. |
